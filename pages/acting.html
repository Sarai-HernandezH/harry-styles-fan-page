            <h2 class="hSub">Don't Worry Darling</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Styles starred alongside Florence Pugh in the 2022 psychological thriller film Don't Worry Darling,
                directed by Olivia Wilde.
                Having premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, the film, as well as his performance,
                received mixed reviews.
                Steph Green, writing for the BBC, noted that "Harry Styles doesn't feel up to the material here, with
                leaden line delivery and
                a lack of light and shade making his scenes opposite Pugh fall flat", but some such as Owen Gleiberman
                were more positive of his
                performance, writing that "with his popping eyes, floppy shock of hair, and saturnine suaveness, he
                recalls the young Frank Sinatra
                as an actor.
