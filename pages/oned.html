                        It is well known that Harry Edward Styles (born 1 February 1994) English singer and songwriter
                        started his musical career in 2010 as a solo contestant on the British music competition series The X
                        Factor. Following his elimination, he was brought back to compete in the show joining the boy band One
                        Direction, where his path to fame and success would start.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The group consisting of Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik
                        (Did you know that the name of the band was originally Harry's idea?) became popular incredibly fast and
                        within the first four weeks of the live shows, were Cowell's last act in the competition.
                        The group eventually reached the final of The X Factor and finished in third place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        In January 2011, One Direction signed a recording contract with Cowell's label Syco Records.
                        Their UK number one debut single, "What Makes You Beautiful", and their debut studio album, Up All
                        Night, were released later that year.The album, which contained three songs co-written by Styles,
                        made One Direction the first British group to have their debut album reach number one in the United States.

                        Their four succeeding studio albums—Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014)
                        and Made in the A.M. (2015)—all debuted at number one in the UK.
                        Midnight Memories was the world's best-selling album of 2013,
                        and its accompanying Where We Are Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2014 and remains the
                        highest-grossing tour of all time by a vocal group. After the release of Four, One Direction became the only group in the
                        58-year history of the Billboard 200 albums chart to have their first four albums debut at number one.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Not wanting to "exhaust" the fan base, upon Styles' suggestion, the band went on an indefinite hiatus in
                        2016, after completing promotional activities related to Made in the A.M.

                        On 25 March 2015, the band released a statement announcing Malik's departure.
                        In the official statement, Malik stated "I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down,
                        but I have to do what feels right in my heart" and that "I am leaving because I want to be a normal
                        22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. I know I have four friends for
                        life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world." Malik denied rumours
                        of any rift between the members and stated "my band has been really supportive". In later interviews, Malik stated
                        that he left the group due to being unhappy with the group's musical direction and his inability to "put any input in". 
                        The group made their first official public appearance as a four-piece on The Late Late Show with James
                        Corden on 14 May, where they confirmed that they would continue working without a new fifth member.

                        The On the Road Again tour concluded on 31 October 2015 after playing eighty shows in stadiums across
                        Australia, Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. Grossing $208 million, over 2.3 million tickets were sold.
                        On 31 July 2015, the group released "Drag Me Down" without promotional material or announcement. Despite
                        this, it still topped the charts in multiple countries, including France and Australia, making the song their first single to reach
                        number one in those respective countries. It also reached number one in multiple other countries, including Ireland and the UK, while charting
                        third in the United States. The single was the first single from their fifth studio album, Made in the A.M., and the first material
                        released by the group after Malik's departure. On 22 September, Made in the A.M. was officially announced along with promotional single "Infinity" being released.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        In August 2015, it was revealed that the group would be going on hiatus in 2016 to work on individual
                        projects but that "they will remain together and plan to work together in the future".Styles stated in a 2017 interview
                        that he was the first member of the group to bring up the idea of the hiatus in late 2014, saying he "didn't want to exhaust
                        our fanbase" and that all members later eventually agreed.
